# Implementation Progress

Tracks progress on `history/wasm/WasmImplementationPlan.md`.

The file has two sections: "Status" and "Context Notes".

**Status Section**:

Each row contains the step label from the detailed, plan, a brief description, list of
dependency labels, Status (initially empty), optional brief note (initially empty).

The status of a row is one of:
- "" (empty) initially, before work has started
- "wip" as soon as work on that raw has started.
- "done" when work has completed successfully. Rarely "Brief Note" may contain very brief
explanation. More details in "Context Notes".
- "blocked" when work cannot proceed for some reason. "Brief Note" must contain a brief
explanation. More details in "Context Notes".

Example on start:

| Step 11 | Port util binding | 5 |  |  |

**Context Notes**:

After completing work on a step, either successfully or by blocking, a section for that
step is added. It needs to have the format from the following example (empty bullets can
be omitted):

```
### Step 11: Port util binding
- **Files**: created `foo.c`, modified `bar.c`.
- **Decisions**:
-- Decision 1 concise explanation
-- Decision 2 concise explanation
- **What was done**: ...
- **Issues**: ...
- **Notes for next step**: ...
```
