// That Math.imul is compiled to an inline `mul` on arm64, and what the
// emitted sequence consists of. imul.js is the file that runs the values on
// every backend; this one only looks at the instructions, which is why it is
// small. Its x86-64 counterpart is test/jit/x86-64/imul-emitted.js.
//
// -fstatic-builtins IS LOAD-BEARING. Without it LowerBuiltinCalls leaves the
// call as a builtin call, the JIT emits one opaque helper call, and every
// SPEC line below fails to match -- which is the point: this file is what
// notices if the lowering stops reaching the JIT. An unimplemented opcode
// would be worse still, since the JIT declines the whole function that
// contains one; that is why both backends had to be done together.
//
// -Xjit=force is enough: the tier reads no property cache and every one of
// its guards is dynamic, so it is emitted for every Imul site.
//
// NOT MODE-SHAPED. Nothing here touches a heap slot: both operands are read
// from the interpreter frame, which holds full-width HermesValues in every
// heap-value mode, and the result is written back the same way. (The arm64
// build in this matrix is HV64 only in any case -- see doc/JITTesting.md.)
//
// There is no -fno-static-builtins baseline here -- that comparison against
// the plain builtin is imul.js's job -- and no `handle_san` UNSUPPORTED
// directive either, unlike the putbyval sibling, because imul touches no
// heap slots.

// The operand proof, once per operand, in the form the bit-op family
// already uses on this backend: convert the double toward zero, sign-extend
// the low 63 bits back over the result, convert back, and require equality.
// fcvtzs saturates rather than trapping and flushes a NaN to zero, so the
// sbfx is what keeps a saturated conversion from comparing equal; an
// x86-style sentinel compare would be wrong here. One b.ne per operand is
// enough, unlike x86-64's pair of exits: an unordered fcmp leaves Z clear,
// so a NaN operand takes the same branch.
//
// The guard admits some integers outside int32, and admits a different set
// of them than x86-64 does. That asymmetry is harmless for imul: the
// multiply below reads only the low 32 bits of each converted operand, and
// those are exactly ToInt32 of anything either guard lets through.

//
// The multiply itself: `mul` on the W halves, which is where the modular
// semantics come from -- the low 32 bits of the product are what the
// instruction leaves in the destination, and they are the answer whether
// the operands are read as signed or unsigned. The result is re-encoded
// with the SIGNED conversion, which is the whole difference between imul
// and a uint32 bit operation.

// And the fallback for everything the guard rejects: the two frame slots are
// passed by address to the runtime helper, which redoes both conversions in
