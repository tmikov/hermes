// REQUIRES: jit

// The PutById inline tier and the "safe store" barrier predicate that guards
// it (Emitter::emitSafeStoreOrSlow).
//
// WHAT WOULD BREAK. The interesting store is old-object <- young-pointer:
// the JIT performs it inline, and it is the emitted code, not the runtime,
// that has to dirty the card covering the slot. If it does not, the next
// young-gen collection never scans that card, never sees the only reference
// to the freshly allocated value, and reclaims it. `hot` below makes that a
// real hazard rather than a theoretical one:
//  - `holder` is promoted out of the young generation before the loop starts;
//  - the stored object is allocated inside `storeFresh`, so once that call
//    returns the property is the only reference to it anywhere -- no frame
//    slot of `hot` holds a second one, which is why every RUN line passes
//    -fno-inline;
//  - `churn` then allocates enough to collect the young generation twice
//    before the value is read back.
// With the card-dirty store removed from emitSafeStoreOrSlow, this file
// fails. In a HERMES_SLOW_DEBUG build it fails loudly, on HadesGC's own
// verifyCardTable() assertion; that check is compiled out otherwise, so in
// a release build the same defect surfaces as a wrong printed value, or as
// nothing at all if the reclaimed memory happens not to be reused before
// the read.
//
// THE INLINE TIER NEEDS A WARM CACHE, exactly like the two GetById
// specialization tiers (see props.js). It is emitted only when the site's
// WritePropertyCacheEntry already names a hidden class, which happens once
// the function has run interpreted. Under -Xjit=force every function is
// compiled before its first call, so its write caches are cold and only the
// helper call is emitted. That is why the threshold-mode RUN lines exist,
// and why the SPEC line uses threshold mode. DO NOT convert them to
// -Xjit=force: that would leave the inline tier with no coverage at all
// while this file still passed. That the tier is emitted at all is pinned
// separately, per backend: x86-64/putbyid-inline-emitted.js and
// putbyid-inline-emitted-arm64.js. This file is architecture-independent --
// it checks values, never instructions -- so it lives here and runs on every
// backend, including one whose store still goes through the helper.
//
// WHAT IS NOT COVERED HERE. The predicate's marking-active and
// compaction-active exits need a concurrent old-gen phase to coincide with a
// store, which no deterministic test can arrange. Those paths are covered by
// the JIT stress differential and by running the suite under ASan.

// Allocates garbage. The object is stored into a global array so that it
// genuinely escapes and is genuinely allocated -- a purely local literal is
// removed by the optimizer and collects nothing.
